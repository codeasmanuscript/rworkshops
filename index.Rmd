<p class="message"> <strong>Code As Manuscript</strong> is an organization that
teaches R through hands-on workshops. These workshops cover topics that
encourage thinking about code and analyses as a 'publishable' unit and as
something that should be made public and shared, and how to go about applying
this way of thinking. Our mission is to provide training to graduate students,
researchers, and scientists on how to make their analyses more reproducible and
to change how researchers view their code.</p>

We get much inspiration for our workshops from
[Software Carpentry (SWC)](http://software-carpentry.org/), of which
we are also SWC instructors. Currently, we teach these workshops as part of the 
[Graduate Professional Skills (GPS) program](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/Professional-Development.aspx)
at the University of Toronto. GPS provides training and workshops that develop
skills that are useful in non-academic workplaces that graduate programs may not
necessarily give.

## Upcoming session

The next workshop will be some time in late Oct to mid Nov, 2016. Specific dates
and times TBA.
