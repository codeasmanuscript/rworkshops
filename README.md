# Code As Manuscript Workshops

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/)

This series of *hands-on* workshops aims to introduce students to the concept of
research reproducibility and to get the students practicing with using R and
various processes and techniques to make analyses less error prone and
reproducible, which in turn making them more efficient, productive, and less stressed.
The ultimate goal of the workshop is to show how to reduce the number of steps
needed to go from the initial data analysis to the final written manuscript or
thesis (hence the name *Code As Manuscript*).
